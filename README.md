### Introduction: 
This project was a crime mapping analysis that intended to help the Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department determine which areas an expanded gunshot detection network should cover. To accomplish this goal, the number of gun crimes committed and shooting incidents detected per 10,000 people were calculated for each of the eight DC wards. Two thematic maps displaying these calculations were created using QGIS, while the automation of these calculations was completed using the QGIS Python Console. 

### Analysis:
The data used for this analysis was derived from three sources. The first source was a point layer that gave the locations of shooting incidents detected by ShotSpotter, a surveillance technology used by the MPD to detect, locate, and alert law enforcement agencies of potential gunshot occurrences (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/shot-spotter-gun-shots). The dates of these incidents ranged from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019. The second source was a point layer that gave the locations and attributes of DC crime incidents that occurred in 2017(https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2017). The third source was a shapefile layer that contained the boundaries and various attributes of DC’s 2012 election wards (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/ward-from-2012).

Two thematic maps were created to assist in the goals of this analysis. The first map showed the number of 2017 gun crime incidents per 10,000 in each DC ward. To create this map, a layer containing only gun crimes was created by using the "Extract by attribute" tool in QGIS, "=" as the operator, and "GUN" as the value. Next, the extracted layer was joined to the “District of Columbia 2012 Election Ward” layer using the “Join attributes by location (summary)” tool in QGIS. “Contains” was used as the geometric predicate for this tool. Following the join, the 2010 population and crime incident values for each ward were placed in an excel spreadsheet. These values were taken from the join layers attribute table under the field names “POP_2010” and “CCN_count” respectively. In the excel spreadsheet, the crime incident values for each ward were then divided by the population values and multiplied by 10,000. This calculated the number of crime incidents per 10,000 people in each ward. Following these calculations, the values were added into the join layer through the creation of a new field in its attribute table. These values were then displayed by changing the symbology settings of the layer to “categorized” and classifying values using a color ramp. The second map displayed the number of 2017 shooting incidents detected per 10,000 in each DC ward. This map was created using a very similar process as the previous map, however, it began by extracting 2017 incidents from the “Shot Spotter Gun Shots in DC” layer. This was accomplished through the “Extract by attribute” tool in QGIS with “DATETIME” as the selection attribute, “begins with” as the operator, and “2017” as the value. After this layer was created, the process to create this map followed the that of the previous map. The “OBJECTID_count” field was used for the values of shooting incidents in each ward. Both maps are displayed in the following section.
